# Data Science Onboarding
January 2018

Get started with Open Industrial Data!

The `OID.ipynb` notebook is taken directly from the SDK examples (see [here](https://github.com/cognitedata/cognite-sdk-python/blob/master/examples/basics/Learn%20to%20use%20CDP.ipynb)).
This serves as a great introduction for exploring the open industrial dataset!
This tutorial will make sure you're set up correctly and can connect to the data.
Then the platform is yours, pick an equipment, find and examine P&IDs to find and bring up the relevant sensors. Create a notebook that tells a story about the operation of the equipment.

Step 1:
- Set up your environment according to [python at Cognite](https://cognitedata.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/COG/pages/25788445/Python+at+Cognite) (pdf included in case you cannot access Confluence)
- Create an environment from the Pipfile
- Go through the OID notebook
- Create a notebook under 201801

Additional notebook inspiration:
- For more examples of accessing and analyzing OID see
the [publicdata repo](https://github.com/cognitedata/publicdata)
- For examples of analysis see the
[ml-stories repo](https://github.com/cognitedata/ml-stories)
